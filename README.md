## Introduction
Understanding the possible relationships between certain medical and clinical factors in the increase of suffering from a disease, such as liver disease, allows creating new fields and lines of research, creating new solutions for the treatment, and possible cure, of these diseases. The latter being the most relevant to motivate the creation and use of Machine Learning (ML) models that are highly explainable or that the information obtained from them is understandable by anyone belonging to both the medical and data science fields.

## General Aim 
From what is mentioned in [Introduction](#introduction), the main objective of this project is to create a ML model that can learn to classify patients according to whether they have liver disease or not based on their clinical and medical indicators related to liver diseases. And according to the requirements in [Technical Requirements](TechnicalRequirements.pdf), the models to be built will be explainable in terms of their results and parameters.

## About Dataset
[[1]](#references) Death by liver cirrhosis continues to increase, given the increase in alcohol consumption rates, chronic hepatitis infections, and obesity-related liver disease. Notwithstanding the high mortality of this disease, liver diseases do not affect all sub-populations equally. The early detection of pathology is a determinant of patient outcomes, yet female patients appear to be marginalized when it comes to early diagnosis of liver pathology. The dataset comprises 584 patient records collected from the NorthEast of Andhra Pradesh, India. The prediction task is to determine whether a patient suffers from liver disease based on the information about several biochemical markers, including albumin and other enzymes required for metabolism.
